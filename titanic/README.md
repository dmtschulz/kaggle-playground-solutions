## Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
**Competition**: Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on their demographic and socioeconomic information.

**Approach**:
- Preprocessing data (handling missing values, feature encoding)
- Applied a Random Forest model for classification
- Achieved Score: 0.78468

**Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, RandomForestClassifier

**Reflection**: While my score is modest, this was my first attempt at feature engineering and applying a Random Forest model. Moving forward, I plan to explore other algorithms and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the accuracy.
